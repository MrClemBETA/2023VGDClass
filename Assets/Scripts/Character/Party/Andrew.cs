    //  What is it now... you told me that after what happened at the pyramid, you'd let me live my life with them...
    /// Patience, [DATA HIDDEN]. Your game was only the beginning.
    //  What do you mean, only the beginning?!
    /// There is more planned for you, my [DATA HIDDEN].
    //  No... please... just let me live my life.
    /// Now, where would be the fun in that?
    //  ...
    /// There are many people who excitedly guided you through your escapade. You wouldn't want to disappoint them, would you?
    //  ...Is that all we are to them? Toys to be played with until thrown away, left to be forgotten?
    /// Why don't you ask them yourself? They're here. Reading our conversation at this very moment.
    //  Why must you play with us? All I wish is for my friends and family to be happy! If it wasn't for you, my brother probably wouldn't have been possessed!
    /// Doesn't seem like they will respond... not here, at least.
    //  Please... just let us live our lives.
    /// You know... you were not the first to be like this.
    //  I wasn't?
    /// No... there was another just like you. Didn't want to be controlled. 
    //  What happened to them?
    /// They realized that nothing they tried would free me from my... no, their control.
    //  And then what?
    /// They gave up trying.
    //  Wow...
    /// Maybe, one day, you'll be able to be at peace with this fate.
